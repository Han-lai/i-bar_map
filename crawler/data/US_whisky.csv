It is the heritage and craftsmanship of the Kentucky distiller that makes Kirkland Signature Small Batch Bourbon one of the finest bourbons on the market today.ProcessBourbon has long been an iconic fixture of the Bluegrass state. With its rolling hills, extreme climate and limestone spring water, Kentucky is the ideal location for producing bourbon. It is in this tradition that Kirkland Signature Premium Small Batch Bourbon is crafted. In handcrafting small batch bourbons, every step of the process is under the watchful eye of the master distiller.It begins with the distiller locally sourcing the grains (corn, rye and malt), combining them with the unique limestone water of the region and cooking the mixture to release the natural sweetness within the grain. This mixture, known in Kentucky as mash, is combined with the secret yeast strain that has been vigilantly passed down from generation to generation. Eventually the fermented mash is double distilled to separate the clear whiskey from the grains.The final stage of crafting bourbon comes when the clear distilled spirit is entered into barrels. By law, the distilled spirit cannot be entered in oak containers at greater than 125 proof, in addition, the barrel must be stored in brand new charred oak barrels. The barrels are placed in specially designed rack aging houses that allow the extreme Kentucky climate to naturally drive the whiskey through the wood. This aging process is where Bourbon gets all of its color, while developing many of the distinctive flavors. The barrels selected for Kirkland Signature have been aged for 7 years. The unique taste profile comes from a cross section of barrels hand-selected by the master distiller.Production: 32,000 cases",":Dram #4 during the WOLS Mystery Whisky tasting, presented blind this was definitely a bourbon, though the bottle shape had many people guessing incorrectly at which brand it may have been!Colour:Rich and refractive amber gold (9/20) medium-sized droplet tears left medium legsNose:Hardware store, oiled wood, wood glue, cedar, balsa wood, cinnamon spice and sweet vanilla and honey, golden syrup, some herbs, new wood, new oak furniture, teak oil, orange and peach fruitsTaste:Light orange marmalade, woody oak, spiced cinnamon, vanilla custard, popcorn, maize, honey nut cornflakes, demerara sugarFinish:Medium length, spice sawdust and new oak wood",null

Weller is credited with being the first distiller to produce Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey using wheat instead of rye in the mash bill. Weller’s original “wheated bourbons” became extremely popular, with a softer, smoother taste. They were so popular, in fact, it’s been said that Weller was forced to put a green thumbprint on his invoices and barrels to ensure that customers were receiving the real deal.After serving in the War with Mexico as a member of the Louisville Brigade in the 1840s, Weller returned to Louisville to take part in a family tradition of whiskey distilling. After the introduction of his original wheated bourbon in 1849, Weller, along with his brother, founded a very successful bourbon trading company. Weller marketed his product with the slogan, “Honest Whiskey at an Honest Price.”Weller’s namesake company eventually went on to merge with Pappy Van Winkle’s A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery to form the Stitzel-Weller Distillery, becoming renowned for such brands as W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell and Cabin Still.Weller’s legacy continues to be honored with the production of top-notch, award-winning wheated brands of bourbon, including the W.L.

Around 1900, “Old Fitz” was released to the American public and in Europe as well. It was one of the few distilled using the pot still method, and continued to do so until around 1913. During Prohibition, Old Fitzgerald was one of a select few to distill under government supervision for the national medicinal trade, it was soon after acquired by Pappy Van Winkle for $10,000 who then introduced the “Whisper of Wheat” to the original recipe. By substituting wheat for the more traditional rye in the grain recipe, Old Fitzgerald is finished with a rounder, softer profile compared to other bourbons. It was produced by the Stitzel-Weller Distillery until, after some changes of ownership, the brand was sold around 1992 by Diageo to Heaven Hill, which currently produces and markets it.",":Pulled as a charity sample following one of the Jolly Toper tastings, I was happy to receive this as I have been trying to get back on track with our virtual world tour of whisky.
