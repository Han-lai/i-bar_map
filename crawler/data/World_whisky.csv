In fact, the people of the Border Marches did not see themselves as either English or Scottish and therefore developed a certain independence of spirit that set them against the world. Their allegiance was to kin, not kingdom. Loyalty was to the tribe, or clan – to family. These loyalties had no border or king, but united them under their clan name.Past hostilities forgotten, this is a union of all that is good.Official tasting notes:Creamy vanilla and comforting woodsmoke are interwoven to create a whisky born of the unique rugged character and heritage of the of the Scottish & English borderlands.

However as usual I try to analyse what is in the bottle rather than the marketing and price tag that are attached and leave you our readers to decide if you think it is worth buying/trying.My own opinion on the marketing extends as far as saying that at least The Lakes are trying to establish a historical context within their local region. The development of a local fanbase is exceedingly shrewd going forward with the competition and sheer number of new distilleries. Also the development of a new category of blended malt of which we probably haven’t seen or tasted the like for over 100 years when last English distilleries mass produced mostly grain but also some malt for bulking out/blending with Scotch output.My tasting notes:Appearance: Full amber gold (10/20), quick, medium-fine tears leave fine legs.Nose: Honey sweet, toffee, hint of smoke, vanilla, butterscotch, slight earthiness, malty or malt loaf – on the sweeter side.Taste: Crisp on the palate and medium-full bodied, with oily and waxy oranges, orange oil, ginger, treacle or treacle toffee, molasses, orange & ginger marmalade, zesty orange and red grapefruit, malt, toffee, hints of clove or aniseed, earthy herbality, liqourice root, wood smoke, cayenne pepper heat, nutty.Finish: Long, sweet, treacle, bitter & spiced element, black pepper.", £64.95

The syncopated rhythms of a uniquely American music were punctuated by well-built melody and shades of harmony; to ask for a whiskey cocktail meant a hearty Rye in hand – bold, slightly spicy and full of warm flavor. From Lincoln to the Dust Bowl, the wrath of battle to the backyard barbecue, Rye Whiskey has waxed and waned like amber waves of grain, its popularity, only recently, reclaimed as a resolute American spirit.Distilled from rye proudly grown in New York State, this uncompromising whiskey is aged exclusively in full-size barrels to ensure robust flavor and nuanced finish. If the destiny of nations depends on cultural nourishment then ours may rest, in fulfillment, with Ragtime and Rye.MoM tasting notes:Nose: An elegant nose full of red berry and clean, classic rye notes. Touches of cherry, golden syrup and a hint of white pepper. Perhaps a whiff of salted liquorice.Palate: Brilliantly mouth-coating. The rye spice gets dialled up a notch here, alongside hearty helpings of nutmeg and cinnamon. Still has plenty of berry notes to it (think blackberry and a hint of raspberry), though now with a pleasing orange glaze.Finish: Subtly drying, with very evocative notes of fresh, juicy clementine lasting.

The cask was chosen for having the perfect balance of pot still, Spanish oak and sherry flavours, which can usually only be achieved through blending – bringing to life Redbreast’s signature sherry style.The whiskey was originally unveiled during a Facebook LIVE tasting to mark Redbreast’s World Whisky Day 2017 celebrations. Participants and viewers praised the quality and rarity of what is now the oldest Redbreast Irish whiskey ever to go on sale, with many requesting that the whiskey be made available to buy.Redbreast Master Blender, Billy Leighton, commented: “In almost 40 years as a blender, Redbreast Dream Cask is a real highlight as I am able to select my own, personal dream Irish whiskey and share it with the world. Our inaugural tasting in 2017 was by far the largest whiskey tasting I have ever held, and the feedback we have received from the whiskey community on the liquid has been phenomenal, so it’s an honour to see it bottled to mark World Whisky Day 2018 – and watch this space for our 2019 plans.”The Redbreast Dream Cask represents the perfect contribution of flavours through a careful maturation journey rounded out by a particularly sublime sherry butt. The original date of bonding goes back to 31st October 1985, with single pot still Irish whiskey filled into re-fill American Oak ex-Bourbon barrels. Then, on 8th March 2011, the whiskey was re-casked into a first-fill Oloroso Sherry-seasoned butt. The resulting whiskey is luxuriously smooth with wood resin notes reminiscent of well-polished antique furniture, lots of ripe fresh fruit flavours and an extremely balanced finish that slowly fades.Redbreast Dream Cask is bottled without the use of chill-filtration at 46.5% ABV and is available in very limited quantities through Redbreast’s online private members’ club, The Birdhouse, for €500 per 50cl bottle. Click here to visit The Birdhouse.Brendan Buckley, Strategy, Insight, Innovation & Prestige Whiskeys Director at Irish Distillers, added: “What started out as a celebration of Redbreast on World Whisky Day has developed into the release of a limited edition directly requested by Redbreast fans. We didn’t know it then, but World Whisky Day 2017 was just the beginning for Redbreast Dream Cask and we look forward to what Billy Leighton, and his apprentice Dave McCabe, will find in our Midleton warehouses in the years to come.”Redbreast Dream Cask tasting notes, by Head Blender Billy LeightonAroma: Combination of fruit, herbs and spices. Notes of orange peel and blackcurrant that move to deeper richer notes including dark chocolate and bitter almond with a heavy oak influence in the backgroundTaste: Mixed fruit tones within the typical style of Irish single pot still whiskey.

This is an acknowledgement of the Scottish education of Masataka Taketsuru, the industry pioneer regarded as the “Father Of Japanese Whisky.” By learning the process of Scotland’s premiere distilleries, Taketsuru was able to bring those concepts back to Japan and launch the first Japanese whisky distillery.The Future Meets The PastEigashima Distillery is one of the rising stars of the Japanese Whisky industry. A family owned distillery, Eigashima has kept production small in order to retain the high production standards and innovative new offerings.The Kikou combines the remarkable liquid from Eigashima with maturation in a Port Ellen cask. This is truly a historic marriage combining the future of Japanese Whisky with an iconic Scottish distillery of the past.Port Ellen distillery stopped production in 1983, ending a legacy that began in 1833.

The design draws upon the Ukiyo-e style of Japanese art which flourished in modern Tokyo, then known as Edo, in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The chrysanthemum, like Eigashima distillery, thrives in the saline rich soil of the Akashi City park, breathing the ocean-rich air of the Kobe Bay and offering complex beauty in return.

Regarded as the definitive expression of traditional Single Pot Still whiskey, the genesis of Redbreast dates back to 1903 when John Jameson & Son entered into an agreement with the Gilbeys Wines & Spirits Import Company to supply them with new make spirit from their Bow St. Distillery. The custom of that era was that distillers sold bulk whiskey to ‘bonders’ who, being in the business of importing fortified wines such as sherry and port, had ample supplies of empty casks in which to mature new make whiskeys under bond.Single Pot Still whiskey is unique to Ireland in general and to the Midleton Distillery, Co.
