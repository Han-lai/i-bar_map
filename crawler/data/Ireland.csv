The cask was chosen for having the perfect balance of pot still, Spanish oak and sherry flavours, which can usually only be achieved through blending – bringing to life Redbreast’s signature sherry style.The whiskey was originally unveiled during a Facebook LIVE tasting to mark Redbreast’s World Whisky Day 2017 celebrations. Participants and viewers praised the quality and rarity of what is now the oldest Redbreast Irish whiskey ever to go on sale, with many requesting that the whiskey be made available to buy.Redbreast Master Blender, Billy Leighton, commented: “In almost 40 years as a blender, Redbreast Dream Cask is a real highlight as I am able to select my own, personal dream Irish whiskey and share it with the world. Our inaugural tasting in 2017 was by far the largest whiskey tasting I have ever held, and the feedback we have received from the whiskey community on the liquid has been phenomenal, so it’s an honour to see it bottled to mark World Whisky Day 2018 – and watch this space for our 2019 plans.”The Redbreast Dream Cask represents the perfect contribution of flavours through a careful maturation journey rounded out by a particularly sublime sherry butt. The original date of bonding goes back to 31st October 1985, with single pot still Irish whiskey filled into re-fill American Oak ex-Bourbon barrels. Then, on 8th March 2011, the whiskey was re-casked into a first-fill Oloroso Sherry-seasoned butt. The resulting whiskey is luxuriously smooth with wood resin notes reminiscent of well-polished antique furniture, lots of ripe fresh fruit flavours and an extremely balanced finish that slowly fades.Redbreast Dream Cask is bottled without the use of chill-filtration at 46.5% ABV and is available in very limited quantities through Redbreast’s online private members’ club, The Birdhouse, for €500 per 50cl bottle.

Regarded as the definitive expression of traditional Single Pot Still whiskey, the genesis of Redbreast dates back to 1903 when John Jameson & Son entered into an agreement with the Gilbeys Wines & Spirits Import Company to supply them with new make spirit from their Bow St. Distillery. The custom of that era was that distillers sold bulk whiskey to ‘bonders’ who, being in the business of importing fortified wines such as sherry and port, had ample supplies of empty casks in which to mature new make whiskeys under bond.Single Pot Still whiskey is unique to Ireland in general and to the Midleton Distillery, Co. Cork, in particular, and is regarded as the quintessential style of Irish whiskey. Made from a mash of malted and unmalted barley and then triple distilled in traditional copper pot stills, Pot Still whiskeys are characterised by full, complex flavours and a wonderful creamy mouthfeel.","The 12 year old expression represents the standard or entry-level edition of Jameson’s Redbreast.

This particular cask had been part of a group selected to produce the Redbreast 21 year old expression released back in 2013. Having met and shared single cask whiskey with Billy on numerous occasions I know well that he has a good nose for finding great single casks and this one struck him as something very special indeed.

Set deep in the heart of barley-growing country, framed by two hundred year old might oaks on the banks of the goodly Barrow in Ireland’s Ancient East, Royal Oak is the perfect place for creating the exceptional quality whiskeys that we are dedicated to crafting for people all over the world to enjoy. But first we have work to do! While the estate’s pastoral lands are in pristine condition, Holloden House, Royal Oak’s historic Georgian mansion dating back to 1755, needs careful renovation.  Brick by brick, we are lovingly restoring the 18th century residence that is to be our spiritual home.  All around Holloden’s walls, once beautiful gardens are slowly re-emerging from the undergrowth, full of old and rare species.  At the same time, our world-class distillery, is built to the highest standards to ensure we can produce the authentic Irish whiskeys of our dreams. Royal Oak is in the name of our tiny local village, where we are lucky to work closely with the farmers, craftsmen and neighbours who are at the heart of our community. As new life is breathed into the estate, we hope everyone benefits from the jobs that are created, the barley that is grown and the many visitors who will come over the years ahead. The Walsh Whiskey Distillery in the majestic setting of Royal Oak reflects our passion for the attention to detail that we believe makes a difference and our family’s dream to create a legacy of whiskey excellence.”Bernard & Rosemary Walsh",":To start of the #WalshWhiskey tweet tasting we sampled their new make pot still spirit produced at the Royal Oak Distillery.

He was ‘The Quiet Man,’ or as they say in the pubs of Ireland, ‘An Fear Ciuin.’”Distilled in traditional Irish whiskey pot stills matured in oak barrels and recasked in first-fill bourbon casks, The Quiet Man will be available in two varieties: The Quiet Man Traditional Blended Irish Whiskey and The Quiet Man 8-Year Single Malt Irish Whiskey, both bottled at 80 proof and sold in 750ML bottles. The Traditional Blended Irish Whiskey is aged four years and has a high malt percentage, compared to most blends, offering a mellow and ultra-smooth finish. The Single Malt offers a smooth taste and floral notes for a premium experience.“The difference between a good whiskey and a great whiskey lies not just in picking the best ingredients and having the most skilled distiller,” Mulgrew added. “It lies in selecting the finest barrels to let the whiskey mature in. Our unique process of finishing the aging in barrels that previously held bourbon but never whiskey allows The Quiet Man to soak up those wonderfully sweet yet spicy oak flavors, and the result is two great Irish whiskies.”The Quiet Man is currently available in Germany, South Africa, Canada and Ireland, and was first bottled in June 2015. It will be available in the U.S. in January, through a joint venture between Luxco and Niche Drinks, whose partnership dates back to 1986.Suggested retail price is $39.99 for the blended variety and $49.99 for the single malt variety.For more information on The Quiet Man, please visit  www.thequietmanirishwhiskey.com, or  www.facebook.com/the-quiet-man-irish-whiskey.",":Many thanks to Ciaran Mulgrew, Niche Drinks and Luxco for the sample of this 8 year old single malt Irish whiskey bottled under The Quiet Man label in honour of Ciaran’s bartending father John.

Secondly, being a blend of all three types of Irish whiskey, it has a gentle complexity. The malt and the pot still whiskey we use give it citrus and spicy notes.Official tasting notesThe early floral yet biscuit flavour reflects the grain whiskey, while the soft spicy notes can be attributed to the pot still whiskey in the blend. The citrus flavour is contributed by the malt. Finally notice the nutty or even marzipan note combined with distinctive vanilla in the finish – imparted by the sherry and bourbon casks used in maturation.Nose: Light sweet citrus and green apple combined with vanilla undertones.Taste: Early fresh fruit leads to a definite light spice followed by some toasted wood which evolves into a delicious vanilla sweetness.Finish: Medium length, buttery mellowness with a touch of marzipan accompanying the lingering vanilla.","First distilled in 1829 in the town of Tullamore in Ireland, this whiskey derives its name from an early distillery manager Daniel E.
