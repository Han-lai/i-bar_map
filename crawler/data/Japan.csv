Helios is famed for its aged Sochu (Awamori) an Okinawan delicacy. Here they have tried their hand and blending malts into a “Kura” profile. They have also released a 12 Year Old and Japanese rum cask finished variant.

This is an acknowledgement of the Scottish education of Masataka Taketsuru, the industry pioneer regarded as the “Father Of Japanese Whisky.” By learning the process of Scotland’s premiere distilleries, Taketsuru was able to bring those concepts back to Japan and launch the first Japanese whisky distillery.The Future Meets The PastEigashima Distillery is one of the rising stars of the Japanese Whisky industry. A family owned distillery, Eigashima has kept production small in order to retain the high production standards and innovative new offerings.The Kikou combines the remarkable liquid from Eigashima with maturation in a Port Ellen cask. This is truly a historic marriage combining the future of Japanese Whisky with an iconic Scottish distillery of the past.Port Ellen distillery stopped production in 1983, ending a legacy that began in 1833. Its iconic whisky is now some of the most sought among collectors.The Kikou is a remarkable, revolutionary marriage of Eigashima and Port Ellen. A combination unlikely to be repeated ever again.Beautiful DesignThe historic nature of this whisky deserved exceptional delivery. This is a remarkable bottle that includes a hand crafted wooden presentation stand. This is a showcase piece that looks as beautiful as the whisky contained within.The label depicts a chrysanthemum, a flower local to Akashi City park which hosts the Eigashima distillery. The design draws upon the Ukiyo-e style of Japanese art which flourished in modern Tokyo, then known as Edo, in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The chrysanthemum, like Eigashima distillery, thrives in the saline rich soil of the Akashi City park, breathing the ocean-rich air of the Kobe Bay and offering complex beauty in return.

This whisky has received 92 and 95 points (differing batches) from Jim Murray in his whisky bible and is held in rather high esteem. Much debate around this whisky centres on the belief that the peated component is made at Nikka’s Ben Nevis distillery, however Yoichi is also renowned for being Peaty and salty/coastal after Masatake Taketsuru setup his ideal distillery to mirror the types of whisky he learned to make at Longmorn in Speyside and Hazelburn in Campbeltown.

Nikka From the Barrel was created to deliver full flavors and richness of whisky “from barrels” which only blenders can sniff and taste. As the whisky contains so many characteristic components at a higher alcohol of 51.4%, it is essential to let the liquid “marriage” in used casks for 3-6 months for it to stabilize and harmonize.

Well known as one of the best-value Japanese whiskies easily available and affordable in the UK. This blend of malt and grain is probably made up of mostly whisky produced at Yoichi and Miyagikyo distilleries, including grain/Coffey still whisky produced at the latter. It is generally assumed that the two major whisky producers in Japan (Nikka and Suntory) have no established trading relationship, unlike Scotch distillery owners who have long had a tradition of supplying stock for various blending houses and trading in stock between each other directly. Nikka also produce Coffey still whisky at their Tochigi plant where their blended stock undergoes barrel-maturation (or re-storage) so some of this may find its way in too. As there is no declaration/or legal requirement to declare either, this blend may well include Scotch whisky in it too – e.g. malt from Nikka’s Ben Nevis distillery?

For his first distillery, Masataka Taketsuru sought similar conditions to Scotland, where he had himself learned everything about whisky making.Yoichi is established in 1934, in the small eponymous coastal city, benefiting from a rough, humide climate. The distillery is located 50km west of Sapporo city, known for its snow festival and host of the 1972 winter Olympics. Originally, the local peat bogs were the source of Yoichi’s subtle smoky notes, while the sea breeze leaves its imprint on these whiskies of undeniable character.Traditional methodsTo this day, the distillation process has remained very traditional. At Yoichi, the pot stills are still heated by a coal fire, a practice which the Scotts have since given up, as it is difficult to control. However, the very strong direct heat slightly burns the contents of the still at the bottom, giving the whiskies a powerful, spicy character.The small onion-shaped stills have relatively straight sides, which combined with a descending neck, allows heavier elements to pass into the spirit. This gives the resulting whisky a richness and unctuous texture which are well adapted to the Yoichi’s bold style.Nikka is bornJust before the Second World War, Masataka Taketsuru founds the Dai Nippon Kaju company, meaning the “great Japanese juice company”. Indeed, for the first 8 years, while the spirits mature in oak casks, a fruit juice activity is put into place made from the local Hokkaido apples. He finally adopts the name Nikka Whisky in 1952, a combination of NI-ppon and KA-ju. His growing success allows him to establish a second distillery in 1969 on the main island of Honshu.The Yoichi 12 years incorporates a higher percentage of sherry casks, offering more aromatic complexity than its younger sibling. The characteristic peat notes are still present, with both mature oak and delicate floral aromas widening the spectrum.","Dram #4 from the  Water of Life Society (WoLS) meeting 7/03/2014 – Taketsuru’s Journey was this 12 year old expression from the Yoichi distillery on Hokkaido, Japan.My tasting notes:Colour: Amber goldNose: Phenolic, sweet toffee, smoked and salted bacon, plum liquor (or Japanese cherry wine)Taste: Full-bodied this has strong sweet toffee and caramel, sweet and salted plum sauce (like duck in plum sauce), aromatic mizunara oak and sake flavoursFinish: Short slightly plum with sulphuric machine oilScore 84/100Don’t take my word for it:Bloggers submit link to your reviewBlog(required)Review URL(required)Submit Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Japanese whisky Tagged as: 12 Years Old, 84 points, Japanese whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky, World - Nikka, World - Yoichi, Yoichi, Yoichi 12 years old, Yoichi Distillery ", £71.85

All whisky styles are covered, including (just whisper it) blends. Along the way a good few myths are exploded, including the idea that whisky has to be taken neat.In ‘What to Drink’, Dave Broom explores flavour camps – how to understand a style of whisky – and moves on to provide extensive tasting notes of the major brands, demonstrating whisky’s extraordinary diversity.In ‘How to Drink’, he sets out how to enjoy whisky in myriad ways – using water and mixers, from soda to green tea; and in cocktails, from the Manhattan to the Rusty Nail. He even looks at pairing whisky and food.In this spirited, entertaining and no-nonsense guide, world-renowned expert Dave Broom dispels the mysteries of whisky and unlocks a whole host of exciting possibilities for this magical drink.",":OK here goes with another book review! After I started the blog I had purchased a mass of whisky books to supplement my meagre (though fairly comprehensive) collection of whisky books. I fully intended to do more reviews but sadly Tasting and writing up tasting notes have consumed a large proportion of the diminishing time I could devote to blogging. During a recent holiday to France I was able to pack up a few good books and choice sample drams and have the time to read (and drink, respectively) them.I have previously reviewed Handbook of Whisky – Dave Broom and found it particularly insightful and inspiring so I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed as ‘Whisky The Manual’ is a very different kind of whisky book indeed. I found this very easy reading, the introduction covers much of the history of scotch whisky making quite succinctly. Sure it draws from the same incredibly limited number of references as all the rest and the rest of the conjecture fits into established thinking. In fact I could have skipped this section entirely – however, I found it very well written and entertaining. Dave only draws on references where completely necessary and instead keeps up a light almost story-telling pace through his writing – making it a joy to read.There are also introductions to both American and Japanese whisky histories, which I found much more educational due to my own lack of knowledge on these subjects.  The introductory elements of the book have been kept to a minimum as this book follows the familiar format of ‘what/how/why is whisky’ followed by the bulk of the book being tasting notes for a particular distillery or expression.Whisky The MixerIn truth Dave could have more aptly named this book ‘Whisky The Mixer’. The second part of the introductory material details common mixers used to ‘lengthen’ ‘short’ drinks such as whisky. Sure whisky is hard liquor starting at over 40% ABV, and this isn’t always appropriate for the occasion. So Dave has looked at how whisky is commonly consumed and introduced a selection of common mixers including Club Soda, Ginger Ale (with a tip of his hat to his supplier, Fever Tree, Coca Cola, Green Tea and Coconut Water, with the later two having more popularity in Asia. Dave introduces nicely the origins, character and effects of each of these mixers.Stills at Bladnoch DistilleryThroughout the ‘tasting notes’ section of the book, Dave describes the particular whisky expression chosen (mostly fairly well-known/standard for that distillery and stereotypical for that distillery drawn from his own knowledge and preferences) highlighting their major characteristics. This includes Scotch, American, Canadian, Irish, Japanese, Malts, blends, bourbons, ryes, pot still etc. The chosen expression is then sampled in conjunction with each of the mixers, mixed at a standard ratio and sampled to observe 1; the overall effect on the whisky/resulting drink and 2; where the whisky and mixer characteristics combine favourably or unfavourably. Although all of this is based around one palate and one set of preferences, it is an interesting scientific experiment as the mixers and quantities are kept standard. Occasionally it is noted where a slight alteration of the mixer/whisky ratio may correct or improve certain taste sensations.Cask size display at Glengoyne DistilleryThrough this process Dave describes some wonderful, and some basically not-so-wonderful (i.e. avoid at all costs) combinations. He includes both single malts and major blends and as an end result derives the ‘mixability’ property of the whiskies involved. Of course some whiskies taste better un-mixed, and some may well in fact be improved by any mixer (over drinking them straight). The end results are interesting in more than just an academical point of view. If someone does ask for a whisky & coke (or soda, or whatever), then herein lies a good guide of what to offer as the whisky component (and what not to waste and save for other occasions). Finally there is a section at the end with a selection of cocktail recipes that draw heavily on whisky or bourbon as their main constituent, which encourages the reader to experiment with what whisky/expression they may want to use based on the previous section.Cooperage demonstration at The Balvenie Whisky FeteThe debate will continue to rumble on as regards adding anything (including water and ice) to whisky as acceptable. I follow Dave’s premise: drink whisky however you like! I am personally not averse to adding water (in fact I commonly do for numerous reasons including 1; reducing cask strength whisky to appreciate the full taste as some are masked by alcohol content 2; reducing whisky flavours I find unpleasing or imbalanced 3; reducing oily or ascerbic whisky – in fact any whisky can take a drop of water and often this subtly shifts the balance of congeners as you change the alcohol/water ratio) or occasionally cola (more with blends if I am honest) and very occasionally ice (Highland Park 12 year old – I love you, but can only drink you on the rocks!). Indeed my passion for whisky increased enormously when I accepted that adding a little ice to highly peated whisky (e.g. Laphroaig 10) made it less challenging and therefore instantly more relaxing to drink.Deanston Warehouse 2bAs a Whiskyphile I am constantly challenged to analyse whisky and sometimes loose sight of the fact that it is their for my enjoyment. I often take down-time or days off and usually end these dry periods with a pleasure dram of whisky – one I can drink without thinking about or analysing at all! It is usually my choice in these that sometimes surprises me as it will often reflect mood, or current predeliction for tastes or style (peated or sherried, etc.) but is always something familiar – so I know exactly what I’ll get in my glass.Display Glenlivet Visitors CentreLastly this book may be highly useful for the more creative types, cocktail makers and mixologists, or even gastronomes interested in food pairings with these whiskies. Wishing to create taste experiences that draw on the characteristics of the whisky and how they change in accompaniment. So if nothing else, this read helped me see and think about analysing whisky in a very different way, and for that I am thankful.  Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Books Tagged as: Blended whisky, Bourbon, Canadian whisky, Dave Broom, Japanese whisky, Rye, Scotch, Whiskey, Whisky, Whisky book, Whisky book reviews, Whisky The Manual ",£5 used £10-13 new (Hardcover) Publisher: Octopus Books – ISBN 1845337557 What they say: This highly accessible and enjoyable guide is
