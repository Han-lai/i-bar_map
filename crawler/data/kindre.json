I would drink the Aristocrat before dinner or on a lazy do-nothing afternoon.\nThere are several reasons why I like this drink: The greatest reason is the St. George terroir gin, which is exquisite to say the least. Its label reads like a who's who in the botanical world: \"Douglas fir, California bay laurel, fennel, coastal sage, orris root, angelica root, juniper berries, and other profoundly aromatic botanical ingredients...\" Pair a great gin with a top-shelf bianco vermouth by Dolin, and Cynar, plus subtle celery bitterrs, and you have a drink making you want another. So have it, and enjoy it!\nIn closing, I should add that those who like that amaro bitterness will like this drink because of the St. George gin in combination with the Cynar.

I like to mix small amounts (~1/2 oz) to vermouth cocktails to give them an earthy kick.\nThe Citadelle is a strange beast.

All said, I think it tastes a little undefined and lost.

Cocktail enthusiasts from around the world concoct a cocktail around a given theme, blog about them, and the all the blog entires are summarized. I don't have a blog, but I have a cocktail database, which think is even better.\nMany of the past themes have been tempting, but when I saw one featuring bitter ingredients (such as various amari) and brown spirits, I couldn't deny myself the pleasure of an entry. I had been playing around with Luxardo Abano, a lesser known amaro with an intense bitter flavor, moderate sweetness, and a strong black pepper flavor. It plays very well with Cynar, the well-known artichoke-based amaro. I had tried various different base spirits when, during my daily bicycle ride, the inspiration of aquavit came to me. Caraway -- pepper -- artichoke. What could be bad?\nI find some aquavit to taste like flavored paint thinner, but the excellent Linie Aquavit is very smooth, with little alcohol burn and a present but not overpowering caraway flavor. I could happily drink it neat or with an ice cube for a change of pace. As a bonus it has a lovely golden color -- close enough to the MxMo \"brown\".\nI suppose that technically this drink should be shaken because it has lemon in it.

For those of you who read the prior comments, let me clarify several points: one person said the drink was too \"unctuous,\" which means greasy or fatty, which this drink is not. Another person said it was sublime, which means awe-inspring, This drink is not that, either. \nHow would I describe it?  Here are three ways: (1) A drink needing to get used to, (2) one that's intense tasting, and (3) one that's bitter, sour, or tart--take your pick. Now, am I saying don't bother with this drink? No! Not by any means. But I am saying the following: First, be prepared for a bitter and/or tart tasting drink. After all, consider the ingredients: Chartruese, lime, and gran classico. All say bitter/sour/tart. Second, like me, you may be inclined to say, \"Yuck! This drink is terrible. I say, take a few more sips; you'll probably, as I did, end up rather liking the drink.
